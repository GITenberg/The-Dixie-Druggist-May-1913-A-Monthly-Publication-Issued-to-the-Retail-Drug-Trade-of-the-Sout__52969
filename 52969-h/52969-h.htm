<h2>“Is There a Crisis in the Drug Business”</h2>

<p class="center">By JOHN I. KELLY</p>

<p class="center">A Paper Read Before the Baltimore Retail Druggists Association</p>

<p class="center">Monday, March 10, 1913</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Mr. President and Gentlemen</i>:</p>

<p>The subject, “Is There a Crisis in the
Drug Business,” which your president has
unfortunately selected me to discuss, is so
vitally interesting and important to each
of you that I suppose there may be a great
many here who have given much more
thought, and are so far more versed on the
subject than I, that any feeble effort of mine
would suggest no new thought, supply no
new theories or give subject-matter with
which you are not already familiar. However,
as I have been requested to give a
personal opinion, I ask your indulgence,
particularly if my efforts do supply nothing
new and are only in the nature of a review.</p>

<p>The “Crisis in the Drug Business,” referred
to and discussed by many, pro and
con, seems to pertain particularly to the
prescription end of it, and as such will be
most considered. “Crisis,” meaning a “vitally
important or decisive state of things, the
point at which a change must come, either
for the better or worse,” somewhat describes
the situation, though it has been a gradual
evolution, approaching slowly, almost
stealthily, until now, aroused, the condition
seems acute, apparently a sudden and startling
metamorphosis. It may be more properly
described, however, as a gradual but
decided revolution in conduct and method
of business, partly due to natural conditions
over which the druggist has no control, and
partly to changes which he has been slow to
realize and slower to adapt himself.</p>

<p>These changes we shall divide into scientific
and commercial. Through laboratory
research work, modern medical science has
progressed to such an extent that in some
diseases the form of medication has changed
entirely, while in others medication is reduced
to a minimum. Chemical combinations,
synthetics, biological products, vaccines, etc.,
have all in a natural sequence deprived the
pharmacist of many prescriptions.</p>

<p>The various salts of mercury and potash
have been to some extent replaced by salvarsin
and copavia, nitre, menthelene blue
seem about to be effected by gonococcous vaccine
and anti-gonococcic serum. Your gargles,
douches, sprays, external and internal
medication have to a considerable extent
been supplanted some time ago by anti-toxin,
and so on, but the unfortunate side of
it is that in cities such as ours much more
of these products are supplied through the
health department and the hospitals than
through the legitimate channel of trade, the
druggist, and oftentimes to many undeserving
people. Some family physicians,
who are nothing more than diagnosing
agents for the specialists, and who, when
called in to see the sick, immediately consult
a specialist, with the result that in about 50
per cent. of the cases the subject generally
finds his or her way into the hospital. The
great number of dispensaries in our community,
with their indiscriminate service and
consequent unbridled abuse, is another cause
for the falling off in the prescription business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The surgeon, the X-ray, radium, etc., all
play their individual part in the decline of
prescriptions. These are a few of the reasons
for a more or less elimination of prescription
writing, for which we may say
that science is either directly or indirectly
the contributing cause.</p>

<h3>THE COMMERCIAL SIDE.</h3>

<p>Several times agents for tablet houses
have called on me and said: “Dr. So and So
has just given me a little order, or intends
to increase his line of our goods; of course,
we don’t sell doctors direct, so if you will
let me send these goods through you I will
bill them straight, subject to a 10 per cent.
discount to you; this means business for me
and 10 per cent. on the doctor’s purchase
for you. In other words, I was to guarantee
their bill, wait for my money until the
doctor was ready to pay, and act as their
collecting agent, for all of which the above
traveling man most magnanimously offered
the above highly remunerative 10 per cent.
and this for the worst enemy the druggist
has&mdash;the dispensing doctor. That gentleman
who pays no taxes on his stock and fixtures,
needs no traders’ license, is subject to no
drug inspection, who is insincere with his
patients, and needs but the occasion to discredit
druggists, as a whole, in furthering
his schemes of diverting from the proper
channels that which rightfully does not belong
to him.”</p>

<p>Another reason is the mistake made at
times by the druggists, as a body, of often
plunging headlong, and with the purest motives
possible, into any vortex created by a
few overzealous men, both physicians and
pharmacists, who are more often theorists
than practical druggists, and to illustrate
my point I recall an incident of more or less
recent occurrence that tended to inspire
little confidence of thoughtful physicians
in them as a whole.</p>

<p>Various medical associations, pharmaceutical
associations, and nearly every journal
allied to medicine and the drug trade decried
the use of hand-me-downs. The committee
on revision of the N. F. immediately offered
us a number of preparations of varying merit,
that were not even good substitutes for
the above, and these I have understood at
the suggestion of some physicians.</p>

<p>Glycerinated Elix. Gentian, if made according
to formula, with its excessive
amount of solution of saccharine and its repulsively
excessive amount of acetic ether,
would never supplant the preparation it was
intended to take the place of.</p>

<p>Pulv. Acetanilid Comp. is as dangerous a
heart depressent as the nostrum it was supposed
to displace.</p>

<p>We were told that Lactopeptine was too
expensive to use as a vehicle, and was worth
not a continental medicinally; that Pancreatin
and diastase were destroyed by Pepsin
in the presence of an acid; besides, after
the chemists of the A. M. A. were through
their analysis, they found there was so little
Pepsin that it was scarcely worth mentioning,
but if the doctor wanted a good
pharmaceutical we could supply Pulv. Pepsin
Comp. or Elix. Digestive Comp., either
just as good, not quite so expensive, and certainly
would do no more harm. Associations
printed proprietaries and substitutes
side by side and launched this matter as a
propaganda of education for the physicians;
material that filled no void, supplied no deficiency
and appealed to many only as a
means to increased profit.</p>

<p>That some physicians did prescribe was
only because they had more confidence in the
druggists as compounders of the above preparations
than they had in the manufacturers
of the nostrum; because they were friendly
enough with the individual druggist to open
an opportunity for a little better profit; because
they thought their patients would be
more economically handled; but had the revisionists
advanced a few scientific combinations,
elegant pharmaceuticals or easily
prepared chemicals, they would have given
the druggist better material for propaganda
work and appealing agents to most physicians.
It was, however, to a certain extent
a wasted effort, lacking in conception, devoid
of originality and decidedly wanting in
producing lasting results. So much for some
of the contributing causes.</p>

<p><i>Now for the effect.</i> Business conditions
have undoubtedly changed. This applies not
only to the drug business, but to every line
of trades or professions.</p>

<p>Our good old friend, the family doctor, has
felt the effects of the surgeon, the specialist,
the hospital, the dispensary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Lawyers, the effect of the title guarantee
companies and syndicated law.</p>

<p>The dry goods and notion business has
been revolutionized into department stores.</p>

<p>The horse dealers, horseshoers and carriage
builders must feel the introduction
of the motor vehicle.</p>

<p>Laborers have felt the innovation of the
steam shovel, etc.</p>

<p>I could go on almost indefinitely, but these
changed conditions are the outcome of science
or commercialism, and are inevitable.
Now, what is the remedy? I had intended
to say nothing on this subject, as it would
make quite an interesting paper or be food
for animated discussion, but a short consideration
of this text is so intimately associated
with the subject under discussion that it
seems particularly well timed. We are on
the eve of still another “crisis”&mdash;a “crisis”
that partly answers the question, “What is
the remedy?” and a close investigation will
discover that a pronounced reaction is setting
in against many of the products of the
laboratory physicians and the faddists who
have led their more gullible fellow-practitioners
to adopt their experimental novelties
and reluctantly have found that practicing
medicine without the materia medica
is like playing Hamlet without the Melancholy
Dane.</p>

<p>The reckless use of biological products,
vaccines, etc., is even now being severely
handled by both medical and lay journals,
and as interesting reading I would call your
attention to two articles, one a serious editorial
in the Journal of the American Medical
Association under date of February 22,
1913, page 602, entitled “Phylacogens,” and
the other in a lighter vein, entitled “Medicine,”
by Cobb, in the Saturday Evening
Post of November 30, 1912.</p>

<p>The man who seeks the little things generally
gets the little sought; the man who
hunts big game, and is persistent, most often
makes a good bag, but the old adage,
“Everything comes to him who waits,” may
have applied years ago, but many theories
and much fact disprove it now. There are
still going to be sick people to prescribe for
and doctors to do the prescribing. Someone
must fill the prescriptions. Who is it to
be? It is going to be the man who can shape
and mold himself to conditions as they arise.
Most doctors are your friends. Even now
the ties are becoming more firmly cemented.
He is dependent on you to a certain extent.
Be fair with him, and he will in most cases
reciprocate. And last, but not least, just
for a suggestion, lend your aid to some concerted
action to control the dispensary evil
by having all applicants for treatment first
obtain pauper cards from the Police Department
or Federal Charities, then see
that the dispensing doctor is placed on an
equal business footing with you, have him
pay his legitimate taxes on his stock, take
out a traders’ license, let the drug inspector
examine his stock for purity and potency,
and finally, see if there is not some way of
reaching the gentlemen, for to my mind a
physician has no greater right to practice
pharmacy without registration than a druggist
has to prescribe.</p>

<p>Pharmacy is a profession of the highest
order, a sort of composite type, requiring the
manipulative skill of the mechanic with the
technical knowledge of the professional man,
and demanding above all other professions
at all times a clear head and an immediate
and scrupulous knowledge of your subject.
There is no profession where demands are so
exacting and mistakes more consequential.</p>

<p>Still you have seen your profession tossed
and buffeted about like a ship on a stormy sea.
You have had your honesty questioned by a
certain class of physicians when it suited
their purpose; you have been called substitutors
in patent medicine literature and advertisements;
you have stood endless vilification
from one source or another and retained
a calm, dispassionate silence, an indifference
so intense as to become startling in its apparent
acquiescence.</p>

<p>Can you blame the public for believing
some of the things said about you when not
so much as a word of defense or a syllable
of protest is offered in rebuttal?</p>

<p>As individuals you can protect yourself
but feebly and accomplish but little; united
you must be a power. Every one of you
wields an influence, great or small, that in
the aggregate will well be worth catering to,
if you work as a unit. You have it within
your power to do much of mutual benefit if,
as a body, you work toward a common goal.
Decide in meetings on that which is best;
start with a thorough plan; play politics,
if necessary, but that politics that knows
no party but the one that is willing to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
your friend and help you realize your needs.
All the resolutions passed, all the enthusiasm
demonstrated in your meetings will amount
to nothing and you will revert into a mutual
admiration society unless followed up by
every ounce of alertness, activity and aggressiveness
that your various committees
and your massed membership can summon to
their aid. Yours is a worthy cause; one
that demands justice and equity, and in all
fairness to yourselves, you want to enter it
with that energy that brings success. You
can remain passive no longer; you must be
up and doing and your rights cannot be denied
you if your demands are honorable, just
and consistent, and I am sure they will be.</p>

<p>Every letter, magazine article and trade
journal containing short essays from druggists
scattered the length and breadth of
this great land of ours sound the same note,
strike the same chord, and are united in one
grand chorus of perfect harmony the summary
of whose song is “Corrective Laws and
Unity.”</p>

<p>Our great trouble seems to be that we
lack union and concerted action on important
matters. Laws are enacted and enforced
by every line of tradesmen, mechanics, professional
men, and even laborers, protecting
their individual interests, and which we
all must live up to, whether we consider
them fair or unfair.</p>

<p>Your plumbing must be done by none,
however skilled, but a registered plumber,
and the law is positive. Arguments before
your law courts can be conducted by no one,
no matter how able, unless he be a registered
lawyer, and the law is definite. No one
dares to practice medicine who is unregistered,
and the law is explicit, but where do the
rights of the pharmacist begin and where
do they end? The unrestrained and indiscriminate
sale of medicines by department
stores, the corner grocery, patent medicine
shops and what not, whose proprietors are
not only unregistered, but whose only knowledge
is to handle it like the rest of the merchandise
they sell, without any restriction,
makes us feel like we wasted time in becoming
registered at all.</p>

<p>Is antikamnia more potent when dispensed
as a prescription than antikamnia sold
in 25-cent boxes by department stores?</p>

<p>Does paregoric sold on a doctor’s prescription
require greater technical skill in
handling than that sold in 5-cent and 10-cent
bottles at the corner grocery?</p>

<p>Does the strength, purity or therapeutic
value of tablets of asperin, calomel or pills
of quinine dispensed by the druggist on prescription
vary from those peddled by the dry
goods stores in 100 lots?</p>

<p>Does the registration of pharmacists mean
simply a guarantee of competency to fill
prescriptions?</p>

<p>Should drugs of a questionable degree of
potency be given indiscriminately to the public,
without someone who understands them
to either recommend or advise against their
use?</p>

<p>Is not the competition waged in the traffic
of medicines to an irresponsible public
by houses without registered proprietors in
fact considered in an entirely different line
of business, as much a hardship to the big
druggist as to the little man, simply a question
of proportion, and if continued must
mean but one thing, “the survival of the
fittest?”</p>

<p>Suppose we turn from drugs and chemicals
to other forms of medication. What
protection have any of you? Only very recently
one of the large general merchants
advertised vaccine virus, and actually vaccinated
his customers.</p>

<p>But the druggist lies supinely by, with
scarcely a murmur of protest, while National,
State and Municipal laws are made for
him. Laws that are definite, made to prosecute,
to handle him criminally and contemptuously;
that afford no protection, allow not
the slightest leeway, are as fragile as glass
apparently for others, but for him as unyielding
and inflexible as steel, and as positive
as the Decalogue; made by men who
have no practical knowledge of the business,
know little, and inform themselves less on
the matter they are legislating. Why does
the druggist submit? Has he become callous
through long exposure to this condition?
Does he hope to win his immortal crown
through his great humility and patience, or
does he accept as a fact that he is following
a well-defined precedent, for as far back as
Shakespeare’s time we find Romeo saying to
the apothecary:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Upon thy back hangs ragged misery.</div>
<div class="verse">The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.</div>
<div class="verse">The world affords no law to make thee rich;</div>
<div class="verse">Then be not poor, but break it, and take this, etc.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, unlike Romeo, I advise obedience and
respect for the laws you have. Make the
best of them until such time may arrive
when we can demand equitable treatment;
when you will live under laws formulated
by yourselves; when your laws protect, and
do not discriminate or oppress; when the
dignity of pharmacy is akin, at least, to
other professions. It may be at a distance,
but the longest road oft-times has many
short cuts, so it is with you now to take the
initiatory step, for, as the saying goes,
“Something attempted, something done,” any
movement toward a realization of our ideals
should be eagerly sought and accepted.</p>

<p>You have the blood and sinews of the drug
trade of the town among you. As an association,
don’t follow the paths of your predecessors.
Establish an individuality by doing
things differently from others. Let
every man pledge his moral, and, if necessary,
his financial support, and stick to it.
Let us prepare a new path and tempt Opportunity,
and when that great, but elusive and
fickle dame, should appear, make her welcome
so sincere and royal that the good lady
would not deign to leave.</p>

<p>Unite in your efforts; combine in your legislative
matters, combine on educational features;
combine on social relations; combine
on grievances; combine with your ways and
means committee. We have a common
cause to work for. Every man is as vitally
interested as the other, and has as much at
stake, HIS ALL. And I am sure by unity of
action on matters well discussed in meetings,
much of material advantage can be accomplished,
and before the sun sets on many
another year many trade defect will be on
a fair way to be remedied, and what now
appear to be breakers ahead will subside,
calmed by the oil of Prosperity, to make
easy sailing for the Good Old Ship Contentment.</p>

<h2>The Druggist’s Duty Concerning
Coal Tar Derivatives</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">F. M. Siggins</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Proceedings of Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical
Association.</i></p>

<p>I am not a physician, I am even ignorant
of the simplest forms of disease which many
druggists are familiar with, and my excuse
for the ignorance is, that I have studiously
avoided that line of study, that I might have
less incentive for the so-called art of counter
prescribing.</p>

<p>But if I am weak in the knowledge of disease,
I hope I have not spent thirty years behind
the drug counter without using my faculties
of observation, and in as short a time as
possible, I wish to register my emphatic objection
to the further open sale and use of
the coal tar derivatives, and I follow with
my reasons.</p>

<p>My first notice of their danger was
brought to me 25 years ago, in the early
days of Acetanilid, by a physician, who gave
large doses, and was enthusiastic over the
results, and saw no harm in its use. A
few months later I noticed that the doses
had been cut down 65 per cent., and I enquired
the cause. “Well,” says he, “I nearly
killed half a dozen of my best friends,
and I thought it time to stop.”</p>

<p>As the years rolled on, scarcely a month
passed by, but what some incident occurred
that told me we have admitted into common
use the most dangerous drugs ever placed
upon the pages of our text books. I have taken
2½ grain doses of acetphenetidin with
salol at various times for colds and rheumatism,
and thought for years that it did me
no harm, but now I am reluctantly compelled
to acknowledge the contrary. For after
two or three days’ use, with a dosage of
2½ grains three or four times a day I find
myself almost completely benumbed and
heart action very weak. And as I recall it
I have always had these symptoms, though
less pronounced, and yet it has taken years,
with all my knowledge of the drug, to tumble
to its viciousness. A physician very near
to me, commenced using the same drug in
small doses and in a short time could take as
high as one dram, but he has quit. Here are
the two extremes in dosage.</p>

<p>Another physician gave a colored woman
the well-known mixture of soda acetanilid
and caffeine and in a short time she was
consuming one ounce every two weeks. The
physician and woman are both dead.</p>

<p>Still another M. D. who dispensed about
1000 3½ grain acetanilid tablets per
month, died with a bad heart. I do not know
how many of them he took himself, but I
have always had my convictions, and I am
reasonably certain that he died without blaming
the acetanilid for his condition. Our
sales for one year covering our retail trade
and a wholesale account of about 100 physicians
totals 100,000 tablets containing some
one of the coal tar products. The patent
headache and pain remedies, estimated in
ten cent packages, total 4000 and the cold
cures 700 boxes, while the bulk goods, covering
acetanilid, acetphenetidin, hexamethylene,
sulfonal, trional, veronal, reaches 15
pounds. The profit on these goods should
run about $400, but the public is welcome to
our part of it, if they will let coal tar alone,
either voluntarily or by compulsion. Now
then, with these figures before us, and with
the facts plainly evident to druggist or physician
who uses any powers of discernment,
what chance have the common people against
the wiles of the impertinent manufacturer
who repeatedly advertises, “Perfectly Harmless.”</p>

<p>I must now give you the cases which
aroused in me the antagonism to the open
sale of all remedies which contain any coal
tar derivative, no matter how strongly fortified
with correctives.</p>

<p>A close friend of mine had a young son
come down with a cold, the physician prescribed
twenty powders, two grains each of
acetphenetidin. Some time after this, the
box came back for a refill. I said to Jones,
“Does the Doctor want you to have these
again?” He replied that he did. This happened
several times in the course of a few
years, and the boy became old enough to
come to the store himself on errands, and
I could not help noticing how white and pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he was, and finally it dawned on me what
ailed that boy. I went to Jones and said
to him, “While it is none of my business, I
want to tell you with all the force possible,
to quit killing that boy.” “Well,” he says, “I
told my wife what you said, and she replied,
That she guessed the Doctor knew as much
as I did about it, so he had dropped it, but
now I believe you are right, and those powders
stop right here.” The boy today is a
fine strapping rosy-cheeked youth. A young
man of this town, a perfect giant in
strength, who could pick up my 175 pounds
and throw me over his head, became addicted
to the use of one of our popular effervescent
preparations for headache. Some time after
he commenced using it, I began to warn him
against the frequent dosage, till he almost
quit coming to our counter, not relishing my
“preaching,” as he styled it. I saw him,
however, at all the other stores in town, and
knew that he was using it regularly. Several
years passed, and some prescriptions
containing heart remedies were ordered sent
to this man, later a nurse was called. I
asked the physician “What ails Brown?”
“Heart trouble,” says he, I told him what
I knew, and he thanked me, not knowing
the cause.</p>

<p>In a few days this perfect specimen of
physical manhood died,&mdash;died in the prime of
life, and with a strength that not one man
in 10,000 ever attains, died because we men,
druggists, doctors, and scientists have been
so slow to recognize the slow, sneaking, insidious
character of these vicious remedies.
No one can make me believe, when I pick
up the morning paper and read the same old
story day after day, “that Jones dropped
dead in Texas, Smith in Maine and Black
in California,” that Coal Tar was not at the
bottom of 90 per cent. of them.</p>

<p>For my part I am in this fight to stay, I
have decreased our sales all of one-half, by
my own warnings against their use.</p>

<p>But how much avail am I to the ignorant
young rounder, who comes out of a night’s
debauch with a big head, and who still half
drunk wanders from drug store to drug store
and asks for his effervescent? No one guilty
because the busy clerk or proprietor did
not know that he had had another just 5
minutes previous. With all this knowledge
before me I have been guilty of openly pushing
the sale by the distribution of literature
lauding these remedies, but no more for me.</p>

<p>And I ask my brother druggists not to put
out any advertising which may contain on
one of its pages a recommendation for a coal
tar remedy. I also hope to soon see upon the
statutes of every State a law similar to the
one concerning Cocaine of our own State.</p>

<p>For I maintain that Opium or Cocaine are
not one-half so deadly as Coal Tar, for while
they openly show what they can do, the other
works silently till the end is near. For our
part, we have quit putting up a remedy of
our own, and I have in mind the adoption of
a label, to go on the outside of all packages
sold, to read something like this:</p>

<p>“All remedies containing acetanilid, acetphenetidin
or like product of coal tar are
dangerous, and should be used with caution,
in extreme cases only, and never habitually.”
Considering the effect on myself, on the people
I have sold to, the evidence of many
physicians who have found out the pernicious
effects and have felt themselves compelled
to abandon or modify its use, I venture
the opinion that, while it is bad medicine
for any one for regular use, on those
who are extremely susceptible to it, it soon
vitiates the blood, and deprives them of their
full powers of resistance, when sudden shock
or disease o’er takes them.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, if by the reading of this paper,
I have converted one person to my point
of view I shall feel amply rewarded for the
hours spent in its preparation.</p>

<h2>The Future of Pharmacy in Relation to the
Modern Development of Medicine</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William G. Toplis</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Proceedings of Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical
Association.</i></p>

<p>The year Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-one
is destined to become known in medical
and pharmaceutical history as the beginning
of the most revolutionary epoch in all of
the experience of those branches of endeavor.</p>

<p>That year brought forth a discovery
whose importance is not yet generally recognized.
Not alone is it concerned with medicine
and pharmacy, but it has performed a
most important service in engineering projects
of world-wide importance. It may be
truthfully said that this discovery and those
it led up to, made possible the building of
the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>It was a most important factor in bringing
victory to Japan and defeat to Russia.</p>

<p>It is banishing pestilence from its breeding
places everywhere, and no department
of life, either animal or vegetable, is beyond
its influence. It has placed the practice of
medicine upon a scientific basis, and inaugurated
the era of preventive medicine.
The day of curative measures, with which
we are most familiar, is passing. In most
of the cities and large communities of the
world, Public Hygiene has become a very
important department of government. Observe
our own city of Philadelphia; we have
there the largest water purification plant in
existence. Its effect, in that city is to reduce
the number of typhoid fever cases 80
per cent. of the former total, and perhaps
100 per cent. of the water borne typhoid, peculiar
to the Philadelphia water supply. A
case of typhoid fever commonly runs three
months. In money it is worth from fifty to
one hundred dollars to the attending physician,
perhaps half of that to the druggist.</p>

<p>A similar change has taken place concerning
diphtheria. Anti-toxin and treatment
are supplied to the patient at the expense
of the communities in by far the greater
number of cases.</p>

<p>Smallpox is practically unknown, for similar
reasons.</p>

<p>Bacterins as prophylactic measures
against typhoid, and a number of other diseases,
are coming into increased usefulness.</p>

<p>Chemo Therapy. The latest advance has
done astounding things. With one treatment
of 606, Salvarsan, specific disease disappears
to return no more. At least it
seems so at this early date.</p>

<p>Much is promised from the same source
in the eradication of cancer.</p>

<p>Leprosy, incurable, from remote antiquity,
seems about to succumb to the new enlightenment.</p>

<p>The extermination of tuberculosis is within
hailing distance. And so on through the
whole catalogue of ills that plagued the people,
unrestrained, less than 30 years ago.</p>

<p>The transcendental discovery of Dr. Koch,
that has made possible all of these wonders,
and many others beside, and others yet to
come, is the simple fact that microscopic
organisms grow in pure culture, upon a
piece of boiled potato. This is the corner-stone
upon which has been built the whole
science of modern Bacteriology. With these
facts confronting us and others of like nature
to follow, we naturally turn to inquire
what effect these changes are likely to exert
upon the practice of pharmacy.</p>

<p>Every pharmacist has observed the greatly
increased development of the commercial
side of the drug business as compared with
its scientific side, which rather seems to be
accorded a secondary place in the conduct of
its affairs, regardless of the fact that this
feature is the one that gives it character,
and the only one that distinguishes it from
ordinary merchandising.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the physicians whom we
knew were high-minded, dignified gentlemen,
who held the ethics of their profession
in such esteem that they scorned to violate
them. We could not imagine any of those,
passing out a handful of tablets to an office
patient for a fifty-cent fee. And yet the
man of today who practices medicine under
such conditions is to be condemned no more
than his predecessors are to be condemned,
because each of them is a product of the
conditions of his day. Truly the change is
to be deplored and the remedy is not yet
ready. Thus we have a dreary spectacle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the most noble calling on God’s green foot-stool,
degraded, through its commercial side,
into a mad competition for existence. There
are some other causes, beside those noted,
that contribute to the same effect, such as
increased numbers of individuals practicing
both medicine and pharmacy. The later
causes, however, are self-limiting and not
necessarily fatal to the calling as a business
proposition, whereas, with preventive
measures well established, it is plain to all
that both the practice of medicine and pharmacy
as now conducted, will come to their
end.</p>

<p>This does not mean that both doctors and
druggists will disappear completely, but it
certainly means that a new order of things
is upon the threshold.</p>

<p>This is the year Nineteen-Hundred and
Thirteen.</p>

<p>Between the years 1922 and 1932 we may
expect to have established a National Board
of Health, with a chief officer in the cabinet
and an organization similar to that of the
Army, in which every physician and every
pharmacist will be an officer of the United
States Government. Those physicians, under
the new order, who remain in the office
awaiting the call of the sick will be comparatively
few in number. The remainder will
be out in the broad domain of practical Hygiene.
Every factory, farm, field, forest,
stream, mines, and what not, will then come
under the watchful eye of this new Army
which, with all of the wisdom of science,
will guard the health of the country, if anything,
more zealously than it is guarded
against foreign foes. Every occupational
disease will be banished, every case of communicable
disease will be promptly isolated.</p>

<p>The men who are to perform this service
will be the doctors and druggists of today
who survive at that time, together with
those who shall be hereafter graduated in
those professions; not that all of these men
are at present fitted for this work, but their
training and experience make them the most
available.</p>

<p>They will, however, be subjected to
periodic examinations that shall determine
their advance and pay, and each one will
gravitate into the place that best suits his
capacity.</p>

<p>The pay of these men will be suitable to
the dignity of their calling, certainly not
less than that of a lieutenant in the United
States Army.</p>

<p>Under this new order the people will receive
their medicine and medical treatment
upon the same plan that they now receive
their public school education.</p>

<p>To the incredulous, it may be said that
the people of Philadelphia alone spend annually
fifteen millions of dollars for medical
treatment and medicine. Under the new system
the cost would be less than half of that
sum, and the people will receive better attention
than at present.</p>

<p>Schools of medicine and pharmacy will
be government institutions, as are West
Point and Annapolis, and their various laboratories
will be the main centres from
which the operations of this Hygienic Army
shall be directed.</p>

<p>To the incredulous, again, it may be said,
these conditions are coming, not because
they are being sought, nor even desired, but
they will be thrust upon us through the
force of economic necessity.</p>

<h2>WINDOW DISPLAYS.</h2>

<p>A great many druggists put too little
stress upon the importance of the window
display. It is a very frequent thing to see
good window space going to waste. Too
often the clerk is left to “put in anything”
and puts it in just “any old way.” This
should not be.</p>

<p>If your window is worth the time and
talents of an expert window decorator, such
as are sent out by the national advertisers,
is it not worth the time&mdash;spare time, let us
say&mdash;of your clerk? It is a mighty poor
window that a national advertiser will not
jump at the chance to decorate for you. The
chances are that nearly every retail druggist
in the South has one very good window.
Take advantage of it. Make a carefully-planned
window display and you will
be agreeably surprised at the interest it will
attract. That is what your store needs.</p>

<h2>DEMAND FOR GOOD PHARMACISTS.</h2>

<p>On another page mention is made of the
difficulty one man has been having in securing
good men for pharmaceutical positions,
and this is only one instance of many
that have occurred during the past year.
Employers who are willing to pay first-class
salaries to good men have been unable to
get them, the supply being not nearly up
to the demand. For a number of years all
of the best men of the graduating class have
been engaged long before they had completed
their course in college, the medium grade
men have been easily placed, and even the
poorest students have had little difficulty in
getting fair positions and holding them. The
only men who have had any great difficulty
in securing satisfactory berths have been
those who have been too lazy to work, or
who have had other traits of general character
that no employer would wish in any of
his employes. Never in the history of the
College has there been a better demand for
first-class men, and it is doubtful if there
ever has been a time when there were so
few good men available. Despite the pessimism
that exists in the minds of some people
as to lack of opportunity for a young
man to advance in pharmacy, it is a fact
that there are still many excellent opportunities
for those who are ambitious enough
to fit themselves for good positions. There
is no room in any business for the shiftless
and lazy.&mdash;<i>Bulletin of the Philadelphia College
of Pharmacy.</i></p>

<h2>THE LURE OF THE “FIZZ.”</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />

<p class="caption">AN AMERICAN SODA FOUNTAIN IN MANILA SELLING
BEVERAGES FROM THE SOUTH</p>

</div>

<p>Few things appeal to us and capture our
fancy like a bubbling spring. As it comes
sparkling out of the cool depths of the earth
it smiles up at us in the friendliest way, like
some shy, living creature, inviting us to come
and slake our thirst. The mere sight of a
spring usually makes us thirsty at once,
no matter how recently we may have filled
up on tap water or well water.</p>

<p>No little of the charm of the soda fountain
is due to the rush and bubble hissing
and swirling and foaming into the glass.
And who can tell how much of the fatal
seductiveness of equally effervescent but less
innocent beverages, with their crimson sparkle
or creamy foam, or “purple bubbles winking
on the brim,” may be due to their hypnotic
appeal to our fascinated eye, as we
“look upon the wine when it is red, when it
moveth itself aright?”</p>

<p>Certain it is that the most popular and
irresistible liquors, from lowly lager to lordly
champagne, are those that sparkle and
foam and bite, with the keen, fresh tang of
carbonic acid gas. Even whiskey has to be
mixed with something sparkling, “soda” or
“Polly,” in order to make it attractive to the
eye or even to the palate, except of the educated
or jaded minority.</p>

<p>No small amount of the charm of “fizzy”
drinks, whether innocent or hurtful, lies in
the “fizz.” The motto, “All fizz abandon, ye
who enter here!” over the door of every saloon
and bar, if enforced, would well nigh
sound the death knell of drunkenness.&mdash;<i>Woods
Hutchinson, A. M., M. D., in Everybody’s
Magazine.</i></p>

of distance when they conform to the following
conditions.</p>

<p>2. When in strong glass bottles holding
four ounces or less, the total quantity sent
in one parcel shall not exceed twenty-four
ounces, liquid measure. Each bottle shall
be wrapped in paper or other absorbent substance

or other suitable material and then
placed in a box and packed in a container
made of double-faced corrugated pasteboard
of good quality. The corners of the container
must fit tightly and be reinforced
with tape so as to prevent the escape of any
liquid if the contents should be broken, and
the whole parcel shall be securely wrapped
with strong paper and tied with twine. Single
bottles of liquid holding four ounces or
less may also be packed as prescribed in
the following paragraph:</p>

<p>3. When in glass bottles holding more
than four ounces, the total quantity sent

The block or tube must be at least five thirty-seconds
of an inch thick in its thinnest
part for bottles holding eight ounces or less,
and at least three-sixteenths of an inch for
bottles holding more than eight ounces. The
block or tube must be rendered water-tight
by an application on the inside of paraffin or
other suitable substances and must be closed
by a screw-top cover with sufficient screw
threads to require at least one and one-half
complete turns before it will come off. The
cover must be provided with a washer so
that no liquid will escape if the bottle should
be broken.</p>

<p>4. When in a metal container, the weight
of the parcel must not exceed eleven pounds.
The container must be hermetically sealed,
inclosed in a strong box and securely wrapped.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stationery.</span></h3>

<p>At this season of the year, owing to absence
of friends, a great deal of stationery
is used. One of our most important departments
is our Stationery Department. We
carry an immense line of all the newest conceits
in writing paper, white, in colors and
with borders. We are making special prices
on fine stationery for summer use and suggest
that you place your order now, either
for calling cards, monogram stationery, or
high-grade writing papers. Let us have
your order now; we will fill it promptly.&mdash;<i>Jaccard’s,

<h2>LITTLE BITS OF NEWS.</h2>

<p>The Pension Office estimates, according to
a correspondent of the <i>Public Ledger</i>, that
the last soldier of the Civil War will die in
1955. This estimate is in accordance with
the results obtained by students of vital statistics.
A veteran who survives until 1955
will have lived 90 years after the close of
the war. The last veteran of the war of
1812 died in New York a few years ago,
after having lived more than 90 years after
the close of that war, while the last soldier
of the Revolutionary war lived 86 years after
peace was declared.</p>

We are told by authorities that a cyclone

a mile. The Omaha storm, while destroying
a territory 24 blocks in length, confined
itself to a width of only about two blocks.

over 90 cents between John W. Ray, a druggist,
and G. A. Hillerbert, who was employed
by Ray, culminated in the death of both
men here last night. Ray was shot and
killed as he stood in the rear of his store,

found the body of Hillerbert, concealed in a
closet on the premises. After shooting Ray
Hillerbert ran into the closet and killed himself.</p>

<h3>KNEW MORE THAN THE CAPTAIN.</h3>

<p>Capt. Robert C. Warr, about to retire from
sea life after 49 years of it, said on the Campania:</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true that sea captains are
sometimes annoyed by passengers who think
they know more about navigation than the
navigator himself.</p>

<p>“I know a captain to whom a passenger
once said:</p>

<p>“‘What town is this we are approaching
cap?’</p>

<p>“‘Derwent, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘No, cap, you are mistaken. Look at
this map here. According to this map it’s
Fordham-on-Tyne.’</p>

<p>“The captain said nothing, and a moment
later the passenger asked:</p>

<p>“‘What channel is that, captain?’</p>

<p>“‘Egg Channel, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, man, you’re wrong again! The
map gives it as Mellins channel.’</p>

<p>“Three or four times this sort of thing
went on. Then the passenger, pointing to
a gull, said:</p>

<p>“‘What kind of a gull is that, cap?’</p>

<p>“‘Look at your map and find out,’ the
captain gruffly answered.”&mdash;<i>Washington
Star.</i></p>

<h3>CLOTHES AND THE MAN.</h3>

<p>It is doubtful if “Uncle Joe” Cannon ever
owned a silk hat. Nobody around Washington
remembers seeing him wear one. Next
to his cigar, nothing is quite so familiar to
his friend as the type of black soft hat which
he has made famous. It recalls an amusing
incident that occurred in the old Arlington
hotel a few years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon strolled into the place one
evening with his secretary, L. White Busbey.
Now it happened that Busbey was always
a good deal heavier on dress than his
chief. This particular night he was immaculate.</p>

<p>A man in the lobby was showing a visitor
the sights.</p>

<p>“There’s ‘Uncle Joe’ Cannon,” he said,
nudging the stranger.</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me,” exclaimed the visitor,
looking at Busbey. “Who is that old slouch
with him.”&mdash;<i>Kansas City Star.</i></p>

<h3>SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>“You drank too much punch at that reception
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Who saw me drink too much?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t necessary to total up. When
I came in you were holding an animated
conversation with the piano lamp.”&mdash;<i>Washington
Herald.</i></p>

<h3>FOREHANDED.</h3>

<p>A German shoemaker left the gas turned
on in his shop one night, and on arriving
in the morning struck a match to light it.
There was a terrific explosion and the shoemaker
was blown out through the door almost
to the middle of the street.</p>

<p>A passerby rushed to his assistance and
after helping him to rise inquired if he was
injured.</p>

<p>The little German gazed at his place of
business, which was now burning quite briskly,
and said.</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t hurt. But I got out shust in
time, eh.”&mdash;<i>What to Eat.</i></p>

<h3>GRANDFATHER’S CRITICISM.</h3>

<p>The christening party consisted of the
proud father, the baby&mdash;a girl&mdash;the grandfather
and the rest of the folks. The grandfather
stood nearest the priest during the
ceremony.</p>

<p>“What’s the child’s name?” asked the
priest of the grandfather at the appropriate
moment.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” the grandfather replied. And
he turned to the father and whispered hoarsely:
“What’s its name?”</p>

<p>“Hazel,” replied the father.</p>

<p>“What?” asked the grandfather.</p>

<p>“Hazel,” repeated the father.</p>

<p>The grandfather threw up his hands in
disgust.</p>

<p>“What d’ye think av that?” he asked the
priest. “With the calendar av the saints
full av gur-rl names&mdash;an’ him namin’ his
after a nut!”&mdash;<i>Saturday Evening Post.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
